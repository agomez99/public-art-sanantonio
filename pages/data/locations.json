Rudy uses this  medium to speak to an audience who may not gravitate to the galleries as he himself has a natural aversion to such curated paces. He speaks to those he views as his peers and contemporaries and makes them his first  and most important audience. He uses spray paint and acrylic but has also resorted to use anything that will  leave large marks. He speaks from a transitional generation in a brown voice. One that is just as far away from his Native culture as it is close to what may be considered American culture. With an honesty and confusion, Rudy works to push or instigate a dialogue to make him and others feel less foreign to each other."
